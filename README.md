# fibonacci_solitaire
A card game following the rules of solitaire and the rules of fibonacci. 
The goal of the game is to make pairs and end off the final pair with a fibonacci number while exhausting all cards.
The cards all correspond to a certain number, 1-9 following the same values, whereas the face cards equal 10.
Draw cards onto a stack until a possible fibonacci number is reached, then put the stack away and start a new stack.
The terminal menu asks user 5 possible options: 
1. Create new deck - Resets the deck without shuffles
2. Shuffle Deck - Shuffles deck of cards randomly
3. Display Deck - Shows all cards in the deck in order
4. Play Fibonacci Solitaire - Plays the game once, alerts user to how many stacks were created and when they ended, and shows win/loss
5. Win Fibonacci Solitaire - Plays the game until the user wins. Does the same as the previous option but also tells user how many games it took for them to win.
